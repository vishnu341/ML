# A program to detect hand signs through the webcam
Collect_data.py is used to collect the images of hands with various signs and convert it into black and white before predicting what it is.

train.py has the code to train the model.

handsigndetection.py has the code to detect the hand signs

predict.py has the code to predict the hand signs

Working: Just run the code in any python platform and the webcam is accessed and it will have a small box within it in which you have to show the hand signs. Currently it works for only ten different hands and each of these signs represent a number.
